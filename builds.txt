# TvX, 1 base medivac rush
# 
# The idea is to get a medivac + marines, as fast as possible, so you can drop
# before your opponent is prepared for drops.
# 
# The mobility of the medivac is what makes this powerful, by allowing you to
# avoid what forces they have, and also go straight for workers.

# TvP, Ketroc 2 rax poke/push with +1
#
# The point of this build is to poke at
# around 5:30, with a small round of marines
# and 1 or 2 marauders. This helps you scout,
# and if they expanded, force an overcharge.
#
# The aim is *not* to win then, but to 
# instead pull back, and come back with stim
# and more units once the overcharge has ended.
#
# You keep denying the natural, multiple
# times, until you win a big engagement,
# or have the forces to push up the ramp.
